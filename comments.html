                        First of all, my website is written from four HTML files and one CSS file. 
                        The four HTML files are index. html, past. html, future. html, and general. Html.
                        The first is the index file, the content of this file is the home page of my web page, which contains a home page welcome slogan, 
                        is written in div format, 
                        and then use flexbox as a large navigation, which contains past, future, comment three hyperlink content.
                        And I set two states for hyperlink settings (by setting link, visited, hover, active),
                         where the black bold characters appear when the mouse does not touch the link, 
                        and the light green-gray font appears when the mouse touches and clicks.
                        In other interfaces I used frames to decorate the subheadings, 
                        and on other pages, flexbox was used as navigation (at the top left of the page).
                        At the same time, I <link> to add icons to my website, which shows a house, 
                        which is also representative of this site just like my home.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="smallhead">
                      <h2>
                        Aesthetics
                      </h2>
                  </div>
                  <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        First of all, my favorite color is black, so after referring to some aesthetic design articles,
                         my interface as a whole is black and white design, which gives people a simple and clear feeling (perhaps only I think so), 
                        in the home page, I posted a picture with the theme color, so that the home page will not look so monotonous.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="smallhead">
                      <h2>
                        Accessibility
                      </h2>
                  </div>
                  <div class="text">
                    <p>
                        First of all my text size and all styles, are in CSS editing beautification, writing content has been verified by a computer browser, 
                        you can show that the theme style is black and gray style, and e-reader interface color exactly the same, eyes will not be stimulated, 
                        and secondly, my text also did not appear any dazzling and animation, will not give people a sense of vertigo.
                    </p>
                  </div>
